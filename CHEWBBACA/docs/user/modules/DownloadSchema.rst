DownloadSchema -  Download a schema from Chewie-NS
==================================================

Users can download compressed versions of schemas for several bacterial species through the `Chewie-NS public website <https://chewbbaca.online/>`_. Schemas available in Chewie-NS can also be downloaded through the following methods:

	- Through the ``/species/{species_id}/schemas/{schema_id}/zip`` API endpoint in the `Swagger UI <https://chewbbaca.online/api/NS/api/docs>`_ page.

	- With a simple curl command: ``e.g.: curl -X GET "https://chewbbaca.online/NS/api/species/9/schemas/1/zip?request_type=download" -H  "accept: application/json"``.

	- By using the DownloadSchema module available in chewBBACA.

.. note::
	Compressed versions are ZIP archives that contain ready-to-use schemas. Simply extract and you can start performing allele calls using chewBBACA.

.. important::
	Chewie-NS generates new compressed versions of each schema every 24h, if the schemas were updated since the last compression date. This means that the compressed version is not always the latest. If that is the case, the integration with chewBBACA allows to quickly update your local version with  the latest information by using the :doc:`SyncSchema </user/modules/SyncSchema>` module.

To download a schema with chewBBACA, it is necessary to provide:

- The **ID of the species** (e.g.: ``9``) that the schema is associated with and the **ID of the schema** (e.g.: ``1``).

	- To know the ID of a species you can:
		- Consult the `Overview <https://chewbbaca.online/stats>`_ table in the Chewie-NS public website.
		- Query the ``/species/list`` API endpoint through `Swagger UI <https://chewbbaca.online/api/NS/api/docs>`_.
		- Use a simple curl command: ``e.g.: curl -X GET "https://chewbbaca.online/NS/api/species/list" -H  "accept: application/json"``.
	- To know the ID of the schema you want to download, you can:
		- Click the ``SCHEMA DETAILS`` button for a given species in the `Overview <https://chewbbaca.online/stats>`_ table to get a list with all the schemas and their **IDs**.
		- Query the ``/species/{species_id}`` API endpoint through `Swagger UI <https://chewbbaca.online/api/NS/api/docs>`_.
		- Use a simple curl command: ``e.g.: curl -X GET "https://chewbbaca.online/NS/api/species/1" -H  "accept: application/json"``.
	
	Alternatively, you can use the `NSStats <https://github.com/B-UMMI/chewBBACA/blob/master/CHEWBBACA/CHEWBBACA_NS/stats_requests.py>`_  module to get information about the list of species and schemas in Chewie-NS.

- **Path to the output directory** that will store the schema. If the directory does not exist, the process will create it (will not create parent directories that do not exist). If the directory exists, it **must be empty** or the process will exit without downloading the schema.

chewBBACA provides the option to download a schema snapshot at a given date. The date should be in the format ``yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss`` (e.g.: ``2020-06-30T19:10:37``). It also allows users to request the latest version of a schema (``--latest``), if the compressed version that is available is outdated. An alternative and more efficient approach that can be applied to get the latest version of the schema is to download the compressed version available and run the  :doc:`SyncSchema </user/modules/SyncSchema>` process to retrieve the alleles that were added to the schema after the creation of the compressed file.

.. note::
	The DownloadSchema process will download the compressed version that is available by default. If the provided date matches the date of the latest compressed version, it will download the compressed version, otherwise it will download the FASTA files and construct the schema locally.

.. important::
	It is strongly advised that users adjust the value of the ``--cpu`` argument if they antecipate that the process will have to construct the schema locally. Schema adaptation is relatively fast but will greatly benefit if it can distribute work to several CPU cores.

Basic Usage
-----------

To download a schema of *Escherichia coli* we need to provide the ID of the species and the ID
of the schema that we want to download:

::

    $ chewBBACA.py DownloadSchema -sp 9 -sc 1 -o path/to/DownloadFolder

To download a snapshot of the schema at a given date:

::

    $ chewBBACA.py DownloadSchema -sp 9 -sc 1 -o path/to/DownloadFolder --date 2020-06-30T19:10:37

To retrieve the latest version of the schema:

::

    $ chewBBACA.py DownloadSchema -sp 9 -sc 1 -o path/to/DownloadFolder --latest 

Parameters
----------

::

    -sp, --species-id            (Required) The integer identifier or name of the species that the
                                 schema is associated to in Chewie-NS.

    -sc, --schema-id             (Required) The URI, integer identifier or name of the schema to download
                                 from Chewie-NS.

    -o, --download-folder        (Required) Output folder to which the schema will be saved.

    --cpu, --cpu-cores           (Optional) Number of CPU cores/threads that will be used to run the process
                                 (chewie resets to a lower value if it is equal to or exceeds the
                                 total number of available CPU cores/threads). This value is only used
                                 if it is necessary to construct the schema locally (default: 1).

    --ns, --nomenclature-server  (Optional) The base URL for the Chewie-NS instance. The default
                                 value, "main", will establish a connection to "https://chewbbaca.online/",
                                 "tutorial" to "https://tutorial.chewbbaca.online/" and "local" to
                                 "http://127.0.0.1:5000/NS/api/" (localhost). Users may also provide
                                 the IP address to other Chewie-NS instances (default: main).

    --b, --blast-path            (Optional) Path to the directory that contains the BLAST executables (default: None).

    --d, --date                  (Optional) Download schema with state from specified date. Must be
                                 in the format "Y-m-dTH:M:S" (default: None).

    --latest                     (Optional) If the compressed version that is available is not the
                                 latest, downloads all loci and constructs schema locally (default: False).

Workflow of the DownloadSchema module
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

   :align: center

The DownloadSchema module imports schemas from Chewie-NS. Brief description of the workflow:

	- The process starts by sending a request with species and schema identifiers to Chewie-NS.

	- If the schema exists, the process checks for a compressed and up-to-date version of the schema to download.

	- If the compressed schema in Chewie-NS is for the latest version of the schema, the compressed schema is downloaded and uncompressed to get a ready-to-use schema.

	- Otherwise, the process will send requests to retrieve the FASTA files with the alleles for all loci and determine the representative alleles with the PrepExternalSchema module to create the schema locally.
